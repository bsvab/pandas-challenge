# Module 4 Challenge

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Background / Scenario</p> 

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.  

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.  

## <p style="color:#CC6600">District Summary</p> 

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.  

Include the following:
* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Math Scores by Grade</p> 

Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Scores by School Spending</p> 

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Use the code provided below to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending.

```python
spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
labels = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]
```

Use pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins.

Use the following code to then calculate mean scores per spending range.

```python
spending_math_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Math Score"].mean()
spending_reading_scores = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["Average Reading Score"].mean()
spending_passing_math = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Math"].mean()
spending_passing_reading = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Passing Reading"].mean()
overall_passing_spending = school_spending_df.groupby(["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"])["% Overall Passing"].mean()
```

Use the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.

Include the following metrics in the table:
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Scores by School Size</p> 

Use the following code to bin the per_school_summary.

```python
size_bins = [0, 1000, 2000, 5000]
labels = ["Small (<1000)", "Medium (1000-2000)", "Large (2000-5000)"]
```

Use pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame.

Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

<br>

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Scores by School Type</p> 

Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.

This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Analysis</p>

In this assignment, district-wide standardized testing scores for math and reading were provided and organized to review the following relationships:

* District-wide average scores and passing rates
* Average scores and passing rates by school
* Average scores by school for each grade level
* Average scores and passing rates by school funding per student, by school size, and by school type  

From the outputs of each comparison (output images are listed prior to this section), we can conclude the following:

* As per capita spending goes up, average scores and passing rates go down. This warrants further digging and analysis to see what other contributing factors affect this relationship.
* Small (< 1,000 students) and medium (1,000 - 2,000 students) schools have similar average scores and passing rates which are higher than those of large (2,000 - 5,000 students) schools. Therefore, there is not much difference in performance up to a certain population threshold, but once a school surpasses 2,000 students, the scores and passing rates are lower.
* Charter schools on average have higher math and reading scores and higher passing rates than district schools. Given than only 1 charter school falls into the 'large' size defined in the previous bullet, and all district schools are categorized as 'large', it is unclear whether school size or school type is the real driver in this case.
* The top 5 schools are all charter schools and the bottom 5 schools are all district schools, which re-enforces the impact of school type (or the similarly-associated size as noted previously) affects the standardized testing scores.
* Since school size or type appears to have a notable impact on scores and passing rates, it would be a good idea to look at some other data points to see if they may be a root cause of one of these being an indicator of the likelihood of passing. An example of something else to dig into that would be size-related is teacher-to-student class size ratios. An example of something else to dig into that would be type-related is parental engagement/involvement.
* If the data is available, it would also be a good idea to look into other factors that would impact a student's time outside of school with which to study. Some examples could be how many students have after-school jobs, how many students receive tutoring outside of school, the average commute time for each student to and from school, etc.
* While scores were looked at by grade level for each school, there does not appear to be an appreciable relationship between a certain grade level and the associated scores. Nor does there appear to be an appreciable upward or downward trend in scores as students progress through the grade levels within a single school.
